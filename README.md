The Imaginary Bank of the Internet is an entirely imaginary banking system.
The money is not real, the credit is fake. It is built entirely for fun
and amusement. Every attempt is made to make the system secure, but nothing
is guaranteed.

This also exists as a programming project to help me practice and improve my
programming skills.
